### Tasks

1.  In app.js register the CarouselCtrl as a controller
2.  Using `ng-controller` make the CarouselCtrl available inside the `body` tag
3.  Hook up the `img` tag's `src` attribute to the active image from the controller
4.  Implement the forward and back buttons so that they cycle through images
5.  Dynamically show the totally number of images and which image is currently visible
