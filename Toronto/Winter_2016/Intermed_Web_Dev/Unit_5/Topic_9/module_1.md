## Description

So far, we've spent time learning how to structure and style web pages using HTML and CSS. We've learned a lot about JavaScript, and how to use JavaScript and jQuery to make websites more dynamic and do interesting things.

The framework we're going to start working with in this module is somewhat of a combination of the two. With JavaScript/jQuery, we've reached into a static HTML page and manipulated elements. With Angular, we're going to use and create new HTML elements and attributes that are brought to life by Angular's powerful magic.
