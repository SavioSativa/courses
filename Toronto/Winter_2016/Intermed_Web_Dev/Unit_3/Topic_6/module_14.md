## Summary

**jQuery plugins** are excellent time savers and also tools for learning how to code (if you inspect the plugin code). Good plugins are all reviewed, concise, easy to implement and well-documented. Writing your own code is always a preferred option, but using plugins is not a "faux pas" by any means unless they negatively impact the functionality of your website. Also, research and determine when it is appropriate to use a plugin, as well as if the plugin is suitable for your project.
