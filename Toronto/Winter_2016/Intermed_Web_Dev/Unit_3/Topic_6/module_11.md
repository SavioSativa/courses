## Finding plugins

The first challenge is finding acceptable plugins. Since anyone can write a plugin for jQuery, it can be difficult to sift through the void of plugins to find one that not only meets your needs, but also does not slow your website down or increase the complexity of your code. There are several useful sites like [Codrops.com](http://codrops.com/) that can provide you with tutorials, demos, and complete code packages for plugins. Finding working demos, reading reviews, and knowing how to search Google and make use of [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is part of the process.
