## Description

Sometimes, there is no need to reinvent the wheel, although it is always good practice to write your own code since then it will be easier to maintain, make changes, and fix errors. There will be times when there is a **plugin** that can achieve the functionality you desire and save you time coding. Knowing how to add another developer's code into your own project is just as useful a skill as writing your own code.
