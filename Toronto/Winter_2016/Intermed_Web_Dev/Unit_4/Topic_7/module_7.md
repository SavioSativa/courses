## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators can be used on number types (integers and floats) to perform math, as you'd expect.

*   Addition `+`
*   Subtraction `-`
*   Multiplication `*`
*   Division `/`
*   Modulus (remainder) `%`

Some of the same operators work on other types, such as "+" for strings.

ex. 1

    5*2
    -> 10

ex. 2

    "Hello" + " World"
    -> "Hello World"

ex. 3

    5%3
    -> 2
