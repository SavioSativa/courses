## Type Casting

JavaScript does its best to try and assume what the **type** of the value assigned to a variable is. However, it doesn't always get it right and the common mistake is to assume it to be a `String`. You can use **type casting** to explicitly declare the type of a variable's value with the following JavaScript functions:

*   `parseInt(value)`
*   `parseFloat(value)`
*   `String(value)` or just putting quotes around the value like so `"1"`.

_This is usually only a problem when working with numbers._
