## Description

So far we have learned the foundation of JavaScript. The programs we have been able to create, however, are not able to dynamically make decisions for us based on the current state of the system.

In this module, we are going to learn how to use **conditionals** to help our code do just that! We will also learn to use **boolean operations** within our code in order to conditionally run blocks of code.
