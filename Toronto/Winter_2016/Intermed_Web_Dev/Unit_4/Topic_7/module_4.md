## What can JavaScript do?

As a *client-side language*, JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS to change the appearance and behaviour of a website. An example that you are probably already familiar with would be Facebook's News Feed. Notice how you can keep scrolling forever and there is always content showing up? That's because JavaScript is checking for when you get close to the bottom of the page. When you do, it grabs more content from the server and renders the data into the browser window.

JavaScript can do so much more. Everything from back-end web frameworks, front-end web frameworks, game engines, data visualization libraries, etc.
