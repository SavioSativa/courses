## Summary

Having the ability to allow our code to make decisions based on input from a user or the current state of the code gives us significantly more flexibility. Our code becomes "smarter" and is able to react to all kinds of different cases. _As long as we are able to predict them, of course._

`if` / `else` statements are useful when evaluating booleans that dictate our code's mode of operation.

`Switch` / `case` statements are useful when we are provided a variable and will make a choice based on whether or not it matches one of our predicted inputs.
