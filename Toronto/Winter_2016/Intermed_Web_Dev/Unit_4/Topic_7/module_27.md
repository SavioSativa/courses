##  Functions Provided For Us

We have already been using functions without even knowing it. JavaScript provides us with some modules that help perform otherwise difficult and lengthy operations.

For example, we have been using `console.log()` to log information to our console. Console is an object that has a function called `log()` which can take parameters and log them.

We will go over more of these functions when we look at objects, since many functions are included with specific objects such as the `String.search()` function we used with regular expressions in our Intro to JavaScript module.
