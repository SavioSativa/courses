## Summary

In this section we have explored the uses of JavaScript and some of the basic syntax of the language. We have looked at the values and types in JavaScript such as:

*   Integer
*   Float
*   Character
*   String
*   Boolean
*   Undefined

Additionally, we have looked at how to do operations on those types using both values and variables (which hold values).  We also learned about how to add comments to our code for ourselves and others we work with.  Finally, we learned how to test our code right in the browser!
