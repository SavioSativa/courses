## Writing JavaScript

Before looking at any JavaScript, there are some key terms that need to be defined. They are:

**Syntax:**

This is the set of rules and symbols used to correctly structure a program for a specific language. In the English language this is referred to as grammar. So essentially making sure periods, commas, words etc.. are all in the right places so that a computer understands what you are trying to tell it.

**Statement:**

A statement is the smallest standalone element of a language that expresses some action. For example the statement alert("hello") generates a popup in your browser with the word, "hello".

**Expression:**

An expression is any combination of symbols that represent a value. We will see this more when covering variables and types. There can be Boolean, Integer, Floating-point, and String expressions.
