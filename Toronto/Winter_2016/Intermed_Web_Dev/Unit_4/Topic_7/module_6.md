## Values and Types

As humans, we look at letters, symbols, and numbers and understand exactly what they mean. Computers are not so smart. For that reason we have to explicitly tell it what it is looking at. Here is a list of some of the most common types you will see and what they mean.

### Integer (int)

An integer or `int` is a whole number (e.g. 5, 10, 231245).

### Float

A `float` is a number with decimals (e.g. 12.217 or 3.2 or 0.111).

### Character (char)

A `char` is a single character (e.g. "a" or even a number when in quotations "1").

### String:

A `String` has *multiple* characters together (e.g. "abdhc" or "hello world" or "There are 7 words in this sentence.").

### Boolean (bool)

Booleans (`bool`) are **true** or **false** values, and are predominantly used when evaluating conditionals - more on this in a bit.
