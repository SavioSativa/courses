## The Chrome Console

We can start by right clicking any Chrome page and choosing the option **inspect element**. This will pop out a window to the right of the webpage showing the HTML contents of the page. At the top right we can see an option called **Console**. Click that option.

Here we can type directly into the console to test any JavaScript code.

There are plenty of more unique ways of using Chrome or other browsers to write and debug JavaScript, but for the scope of this section, entering simple commands is all you need.
