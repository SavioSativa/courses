## Logical (Boolean) Operators

Logical operators are operators that can be applied to Boolean values. These operations are often used in decision making.

### AND "&&" OPERATION

The logical AND operator only results in true if both the values given to it are true.

ex. 1

    true && true
    -> true

ex. 2

    false && true
    -> false

ex. 3

    false && false
    -> false

### OR "||" OPERATION

The logical OR operator only results in true if one of the values given is true.

ex. 1

    true || true
    -> true

ex. 2

    false || true
    -> true

ex. 3

    false || false
    -> false

### NOT "!" OPERATION

The NOT operator gives the opposite of the value it is given.

ex.

    !true 
    -> false

### COMPARISONS

These are operations we often see in mathematics when comparing two values. We see such symbols as `<` (is less than), `>` (is greater than), `==` (is equal to), `<=` (is less than or equal to), etc.

ex. 1

    1 < 2
    -> true

ex. 2

    "Hello" == "Hello"
    -> true

ex. 3

    12 >= 200
    -> false
