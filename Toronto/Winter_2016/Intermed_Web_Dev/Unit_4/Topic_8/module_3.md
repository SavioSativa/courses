## Instructions

Congratulations! You just scored a contract to develop the starting portion of a car manufacturer's internal software.

You just had your meeting and took down the following notes on what the software needs to do:

1.  Provide a simple way for someone to create `Car` objects.
2.  Provide a simple way for a car factory to be made.
3.  Cars require you to store the make, model, and color.
4.  Car factories require you to have the brand (make), model (each factory only creates one model), color (only one color for a factory), and the number of cars it needs to manufacture.
5.  Each car factory has a method called `manufacture` which creates all the required car objects and stores them in an array in the factory.

NOTE: You should only require two objects. A car factory and a car object. Those two objects will share one property. Ask questions if needed!
