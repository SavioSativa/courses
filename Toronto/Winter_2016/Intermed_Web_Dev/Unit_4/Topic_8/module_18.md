##  Description

So far we have learned some of the basic syntax of JavaScript such as declaring variables and performing basic operations. We've also begun developing an understanding of some more advanced topics to help with our development.

We have mostly just worked with our code line by line. It would be very helpful if we could define a group of lines of code we would like to run together and encapsulate it so that it can be called with one simple action. We can achieve this using **functions**!

In this module we will work with functions that are helpful to us provided by JavaScript modules, as well as create our own.
