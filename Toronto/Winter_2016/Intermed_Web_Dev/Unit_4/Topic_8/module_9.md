## Instructions

Write an application that simulates a **journal**. A journal is essentially a list of **entries**. Make sure that you can do all of the following things:

*   Create a journal. When you create it, it should have no entries.
*   Create an entry. Each entry should have a _title_, _content_, and an _author_.
*   Add an entry to your journal.
*   Display all the entries in your journal.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Before you get started, think about what kind of objects you want to create, and what those objects are responsible for.</div>

Once you've got that working, add more functionality!

*   When you're displaying an entry, make it look pretty.
*   Add _timestamp_s to your entries when creating them.
*   Add _tag_s to entries. An entry should be able to have any number of tags.
*   Add the ability to find all entries in your journal with a specific tag
*   Add the ability to find all entries in your journal that contain a specific string
*   Add the ability to display a specific entry
*   Add the ability to display a specific list of entries
*   Delete a specified entry

All the functions you are writing should be written within the constructor functions for your objects.
