## Critical Reflection & Self-Assessment
1. How does a magic 8-ball work, and how does it relate to conditional logic?
2. When do you need an else statement and when would you omit adding one?
3. Why should you use a series of if/else statements instead of just a series of if statements?
4. Can you think of other simple games you can model into computer logic?
