## Instructions

Download this [zip file](https://ce1cd149051ddc9481b6-f8e9da132f3f4dcd72ee74f6806d20f5.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/immersive/magic8ball.zip) and extract its contents into a folder on your computer. Inside the ```JS``` folder look for a file called ```app.js```. There you will see a skeleton for the function you need to write. The two things you need to know are:

* The ```show_message``` function receives a random number between 1 and the value the ```number_of_options``` variable is set to.
* The code that does a majority of the work is in the ```hidden_app.js``` file. You can investigate this file if you are interested in how it works, but it is not necessary to complete this challenge

When you are done writing the conditionals, attempt to model the entire process of how a magic 8 ball works using pseudo code. Pseudo code is a technique where programmers can write out a program or function using a languages syntax, but largely just describing the expressions or statements and not worrying about writing the explicit syntax. It is a useful technique for understanding how a program should work before actually writing the code, consider it part of the planning stage.

You can read up on pseudo code here: [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs482/2003su/handouts/pseudocode.pdf](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs482/2003su/handouts/pseudocode.pdf)
