##  JavaScript Editor

In this portion of the JavaScript tutorial, we are going to need something more flexible than the small console window at the side of our browser to write multiple lines of code!

We are going to use [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) to edit and run our JavaScript code. Open JSFiddle in a new tab and make sure you have the console open as well in order to see anything that we log to it.
