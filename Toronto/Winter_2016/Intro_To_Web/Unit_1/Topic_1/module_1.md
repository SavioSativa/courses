##Getting Started

Welcome to the BrainStation Intermediate Web Development prep course! This prep course will help prepare you for the Intermediate Web Development course by introducing you to ideas and concepts that are vital to becoming a proficient web developer. All you will need to complete this prep course is the web browser you're reading this in and your mind (and maybe a pen and paper on occasion).

Throughout the prep course you will be presented with reading material and concepts to think about. There will be accompanying challenges to some of these sections that you are required to complete. This prep course is not an evaluation; it only serves to help us create a more tailored learning experience.
