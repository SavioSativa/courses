##Outcomes and Objectives

Over the 12 weeks of the Intermediate Web Development course, you will learn the tools and skills needed to build complete Internet driven applications (web apps, colloquially). Web apps are really just the next evolution of software development. Modern developers can now leverage the speed of the internet and the power of modern browsers to build software that was not possible just a decade ago.

Learning how to code is only one aspect of software development. At its core, software development has always been about solving problems. Developers utilize available technologies to create solutions to new problems, and new solutions to old problems. The challenge isn't to solve problems like the first humans solved the problem of the wheel, but to solve problems like the computers we created are designed to solve them. The purpose of this prep course is to get your mind thinking like a computer does to solve problems in order to build meaningful and useful applications.

Below are things you should consider while working through the prep course:

* How to identify problems and potential solutions
* How to deconstruct complex problems into smaller and smaller pieces
* How to combine smaller problems into more complex ones
* How to solve a problem in the real world
* How a computer solves the same problem
