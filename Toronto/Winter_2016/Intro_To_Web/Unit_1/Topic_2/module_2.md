## The Command Line

The quickest and easiest way to use git is through the command line (also referred to as console). 

* For Mac users, this is achieved by launching **Terminal** from the *Spotlight* search (click the magnifying glass in the corner of your screen and type Terminal). 
* For Windows users, you should use the **git bash** provided as part of your download of git. Windows has the DOS command line but the commands are different from the unix commands used by servers and Mac's.
